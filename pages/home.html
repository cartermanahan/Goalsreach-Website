                Goalsreach is a self-accountability system. You set the goals, habits and rewards.
                You earn Accountability Points when you show up, and you spend them when it’s
                time to enjoy yourself — no more guilt, no more pretending you’re “on it” when you’re not.

            The app is simple on purpose. Three moving parts — goals, habits and rewards — all
            tied together by Accountability Points. No clutter, no endless options. Just a clear
            system that rewards follow-through and exposes excuses.

        <p class="gr-intro">
            Everything runs through Accountability Points — your real-life XP. You build AP by
            doing the work, and you spend it when you decide to enjoy yourself. Discipline in,
            indulgence out. No grey area.

                <p>
                    You set AP values for every goal and reward. Harder work earns more. Bigger
                    indulgences cost more. The app makes the trade-offs visible so you can’t lie
                    to yourself about where your effort is really going.

                    deadlines or skip what you said you’d do, and you don’t get the points. Simple,
                    binary, ruthless in the right way.

                    new hoodie, that late-night gaming session — all of it sits behind the
                    work you chose. The system makes indulgence feel clean instead of shameful.

                how you think about effort, comfort and what you are actually capable of.

                    Goalsreach will grow with an integrated AI assistant — helping you set smarter
                    goals, break them into sub-goals, suggest AP values and spot when you’re about to
                    fall off. Less guesswork, more intelligent pressure.

        <div class="gr-faq-grid">
            <article class="gr-faq-item">
                <h3>“Apps like this never work for me. Why is this different?”</h3>
                <p>
                    Most apps try to organise your life. Goalsreach does something more direct: it
                    ties your comfort to your discipline. You feel the cost of skipping work, and you
                    feel the win when you earn what you want. That tension is what keeps you engaged.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="gr-faq-item">
                <h3>“Is it complicated?”</h3>
                <p>
                    No. Goals, habits, rewards, AP. That’s it. Everything is laid out in a calm,
                    minimal interface. You’ll understand the system within a few minutes and spend
                    your time using it, not configuring it.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="gr-faq-item">
                <h3>“What if I’m ‘too lazy’ to keep using it?”</h3>
                <p>
                    Then you finally see the problem in black and white. When your rewards are locked
                    behind AP and your AP isn’t moving, there’s nowhere to hide. That clarity is
                    exactly what most people have been missing.
                </p>

            <article class="gr-faq-item">
                <h3>“Will this suddenly fix my whole life?”</h3>
                <p>
                    No app can do that. What Goalsreach does is give you a structure that makes it
                    much harder to drift and much easier to stay honest with yourself. From there,
                    the compounding is on you.

                <h3>“Is this only for ‘high performers’?”</h3>
                <p>
                    No. It’s for anyone who’s done being average on purpose. Whether you’re at school,
                    uni, work or in limbo, the system meets you where you are and forces you to own
                    the gap between where you are and where you say you want to be.

                <h3>“Do I need big goals to use this?”</h3>
                <p>
                    You can start small. Cleaning your room, fixing your sleep, getting to the gym,
                    studying properly, building one small income stream. The point is that everything
                    now sits in one accountable structure instead of in your head.

                    This app has fully turned that around. Setting clear goals and knowing there’s a reward at the end makes me actually want to get things done. Its like I’m finally productive again and leveling up in real life🤌👏🏻

                    The design feels like an app which Apple made themselves, and it’s super fun to use. It’s like I’m addicted to actually achieving my goals which is incredible.
