            <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
   <p>
    Goalsreach (“we”, “us”, “our”) is responsible for operating the Goalsreach app and the
    goalsreach.co.uk website. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use and protect
    your information when you use our services.
</p>
            <p>
                For users in the UK and the European Economic Area (EEA), Goalsreach is the
                “data controller” of your personal information. For some services, we rely on third-party
                providers (such as Google Firebase and Apple) who act as “data processors” or independent
                controllers of some data.
            </p>
        </article>

        <article class="legal-section">
            <h2>2. Information we collect</h2>
            <p>
                We only collect the information we need to operate the app, keep your account working and
                understand how Goalsreach is being used.
            </p>

            <h3>2.1 Information you provide to us</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account details</strong> – such as your email address and password (or sign-in method),
                    when you create an account or sign in. Your password is handled securely via our authentication
                    provider and is not stored in plain text.</li>
                <li><strong>Profile and in-app content</strong> – including goals, habits, rewards, streaks,
                    notes and other content you choose to store inside the app.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase-related information</strong> – when you subscribe to Goalsreach Premium,
                    Apple provides us with limited information about your subscription status (for example,
                    whether you are in a free trial or an active subscription period). We do not receive or
                    store your full payment card details.</li>
                <li><strong>Support and communication</strong> – if you contact us by email or via in-app forms,
                    we may collect your name, email address and the content of your message.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Information collected automatically</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device and usage information</strong> – such as device model, operating system version,
                    language, app version, basic event information (for example screens viewed and features used)
                    and diagnostics. This helps us keep Goalsreach stable, secure and easy to use.</li>
                <li><strong>Log data</strong> – when the app encounters an error or crash, technical details may
                    be logged (for example timestamp, error type and limited device information) so we can fix
                    issues and improve performance.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.3 Information from third parties</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Apple App Store</strong> – Apple processes your purchase and payment details when you
                    subscribe. We receive anonymised or limited information such as subscription status and
                    region, but not your full billing information.</li>
                <li><strong>Firebase services</strong> – we use Firebase (provided by Google) for authentication,
                    data storage and analytics. Depending on your device settings, Firebase may collect technical
                    identifiers and usage events on our behalf. These are used to keep your account working and
                    to help us understand how Goalsreach is used in aggregate.</li>

        <article class="legal-section">
            <h2>3. How we use your information</h2>
            <p>We use your information for the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>To provide and maintain Goalsreach</strong> – including creating and managing your
                    account, syncing your data, calculating Accountability Points and delivering core features.</li>
                <li><strong>To improve the app</strong> – by analysing aggregated usage data and crash reports so
                    we can prioritise improvements, fix bugs and develop new features.</li>
                <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong> – for example about changes to the app, updates to
                    this Policy, support responses or important service notices. We keep marketing-style
                    communication to a minimum.</li>
                <li><strong>To manage subscriptions</strong> – including verifying your subscription status with
                    Apple and delivering Premium features while your subscription is active.</li>
                <li><strong>To keep Goalsreach secure</strong> – for example by monitoring for abuse, preventing
                    unauthorised access and enforcing our Terms of Use.</li>
                <li><strong>To comply with legal obligations</strong> – where we are required to retain or disclose
                    certain information under applicable law.</li>

            <h2>4. Legal bases (UK &amp; EEA users)</h2>
            <p>
                If you are in the United Kingdom or the EEA, we process your personal information under one or more
                of the following legal bases:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – where processing is necessary to provide you with
                    the app and any subscription features you have requested.</li>
                <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – for example to maintain and improve Goalsreach, prevent
                    fraud and keep our services secure. We balance these interests against your rights and
                    expectations.</li>
                <li><strong>Consent</strong> – where you have actively given us permission (for example, if we ever
                    introduce optional marketing communications or additional analytics controls).</li>
                <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> – where we must process or retain information to comply with
                    applicable law.</li>

            <h2>5. How we share your information</h2>
            <p>
                We do not sell your personal data. We only share it when necessary to run Goalsreach, when you ask
                us to, or when we are legally required to.
            </p>
            <h3>5.1 Service providers</h3>
            <p>We use trusted third-party providers to help us operate the app, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> – for authentication, secure data storage and analytics.</li>
                <li><strong>Apple</strong> – for app distribution, in-app purchases and subscription billing.</li>
                <li><strong>Email and support tools</strong> – to receive and respond to support requests.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These providers only process your information on our instructions, are bound by contractual
                obligations of confidentiality and data protection, and may not use your information for their own
                purposes.
            </p>

            <h3>5.2 Legal and safety reasons</h3>
            <p>
                We may disclose information about you if we reasonably believe it is necessary to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>comply with a law, regulation, court order or other legal request;</li>
                <li>protect the rights, property or safety of Goalsreach, our users or others;</li>

            <h2>6. International transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Goalsreach is operated from the United Kingdom, but some of our service providers (including
                Firebase and Apple) may process data in other countries, such as the United States or within the
                EEA. Where personal data is transferred outside the UK or EEA, we aim to ensure appropriate
                safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent protections, as
                required by applicable data-protection laws.

            <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
            <p>
                We keep your personal information only for as long as we have a valid reason to do so – for example
                while your account is active or as needed to provide you with the app, meet our legal obligations,
                resolve disputes or enforce our agreements.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Account and in-app content</strong> – kept while your account is active. If you ask us
                    to delete your account, we will remove or anonymise your personal data within a reasonable
                    period, subject to any legal requirements to retain certain records.</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics and logs</strong> – kept for shorter periods where possible and used
                    primarily in aggregate form.</li>

            <p>
                We use appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your information, including
                encryption in transit, secure authentication and access controls. However, no method of
                transmission or storage over the internet is completely risk-free, so we cannot guarantee absolute
